Over the past few years, the U.S. has dominated the globe in being the most popular university destination for students from all over the world. And New York is not only a cosmopolitan city full of opportunity and charm, it is also home to some of the world’s most prestigious universities. What about high schools in New York? We want to know what high school education in New York is like. What is the geographical distribution of high schools in New York? Are these distributions evenly? And we all know that high school studies are very important to get into a good university, and there are many websites that rank these high schools. Is it true that the schools that are ranked at the bottom of the list are very different from the top one? Also, people have experienced the epidemic for the past two years, what kind of impact has the epidemic had on high school education? Has it influence the attendance of students? We hope to analyze some datasets to better understand New York high school education and to answer the above questions. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Data sources The data is from the NYC Open data website. It is a New York City Department of Education 2020 - 2021 School Quality Report Results for High School. This data has 487 rows which represent for each high school in NYC and 391 columns represent for detailed indicators showing the quality of education, including dbn, enrollment, feedback of students, curriculum, SAT scores, ACT scores, graduation rates, etc. Link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2020-2021-School-Quality-Reports-High-School/26je-vkp6 This data shows the rank of high school in NYC offered by SchoolDIgger. We could filter the data for each year from 2005-2006 to 2018-2019. There are 14-years of data in total. By combining this data with the first data, we know the ranking of each school and the information that makes up the ranking, which makes it easier to analyze the difference between high and low ranking Link: https://www.schooldigger.com/go/NY/schoolrank.aspx?level=3 The data is from the NYC Open data website. It is a daily listing of students enrolled, present, absent or released statistical count by and school. We used to analyze the effect of Covid-19 on attendance. Link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2018-2021-Daily-Attendance-by-School/xc44-2jrh This data is Covid-19 trends data by day offered by NYC Official Website, and it is also an open data on Github. We will use the trend graph of covid to compare high school attendance and analyze whether covid has an effect on attendance Link: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/trends/data-by-day.csv This data shows the Boundaries of School Districts in NYC from the NYC Open data website. And we will use this data to show the geographic distribution. Link：https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYC-School-District-Boundaries/p5vh-vm7p "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Since the datasets are stored in a .csv file, we can simply read the file using the read.csv method. When we need to do manipulation on data, we will use dplyr to help us solve the most data manipulation challenges like cleaning data, adding columns, transforming rows and columns, etc. Of course, when the operation is not so complicated, we will also consider using Base R. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values There are four dataset used in our project, but only one of them, dataset 1, exist missing value. Some variable shows “No Data”. In this part, we will focus on them. Since we are interested in the fairness of the quality of High School education in NYC and there are 391 columns in the dataset which shows most of the details of the each school, we will only analyze a part of them that we might used later. 4.0.0.1 4.1 By Row We first consider the missing value by row. From the graph above, we could find that over 60% of rows have 4 columns missing, nearly 25% of rows have 8 columns missing. There exist few rows with nearly half of the missing value. Only 12.5% of rows are complete cases. 4.0.0.2 4.2 By column Then, We analyze the missing value by column. From the missing patterns above, there are 4 columns(about val_mean of act score) with nearly 90% of missing value, and another 4 columns(about n_mean of act score) have around 65% of missing value. And we could also find that it seems like if “n_mean of act score” variables are missing, then “val_mean of act score” will be missing. 4.0.1 4.3 By value In this part, we try to find whether the value of some variable will help us predict missing in other columns. It seems like there is a relationship between ACT scores and districts. Staten Island has less missing value, than other 4 districts. And the higher mean score is, the more missing value will be. To sum up, ACT score variables contain most of the missing value and missing value of other variables will not influence the analysis of our problem. Then we will use other exam grades to analyze the varying of High School education. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Allocation of Educational Resources in NYC 5.2 Education Quality Distribution in NYC 5.3 The Impact of Varying-ranking High School Education Quality 5.4 Impact of Covid on attendance", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Allocation of Educational Resources in NYC First, we will analyze the allocation of educational resources of high schools in NYC. There are several detailed questions we will focus: Which borough are most high schools located in? Based on the area of each county, is the school density the same? Is there difference of the average area a school need to cover? Is every school district having the same number of high schools? We thought that New York high schools might be largely concentrated in Manhattan, just like universities. But the truth is different. In this dataset, there are 487 high schools, and from the bar chart above, we could find that the kings County has the most high schools, followed by the Bronx County, the Manhattan County and the Queens County. The Richmond County has the least high schools and there is a huge gap between the number of high schools in the Queens County and the Richmond County. In the graph above, we aim to Know the average area the a school in different districts need to cover, calculating by the ratio of area of district and total number of schools in that district. We found that a school in the Richmond County need to cover the largest area and there is a huge gap between the Richmond County and any other county. The Queens County, the Kings County, the Bronx County and Manhattan are followed. Based on the two bar charts above, we could find that a school in the Richmond County need to cover since the number of schools in the Richmond County is such fewer than other county. The Manhattan County does not has the most high schools, but a school in the Manhattan County need to cover the least area since the number of high schools is more than some other counties. 5.2 Education Quality Distribution in NYC Secondly, we combine school data with ranking data and aim to find the answer on the following questions: What is the distribution of varying ranking of High School in NYC? Are them distributed fairly? From the map above, we could find that District 2, belongs to the Manhattan County, has the most high schools,which is over 50. Then, District 10, belongs to the Bronx County, has the second most high schools, between 20 and 30. Other Districts have less than 20 high schools and each District has at least one high school. Based on the mosaic plot above, we compare the rank level of high schools in different Counties. K represents for the Kings County, M represents for the Manhattan County, Q represents for the Queens County, R represents for the Richmond County and X represents for the Bronx County. Each color represent the increase number between two different level of ranks. We could find that for all counties except the Richmond County, high schools over top 100 take the largest share, while school rank between 50 and 100 is the largest share in the Richmond County. For the Kings County, the Queens county and the Bronx County, rank of school between 50 and 100 is the second largest share. For the Manhattan County, the increase number of high school under rank 100 seems uniformly distributed. Maps above show the distribution of high school in varying ranks. For top 10 high schools, 5 of them located in District 2, other 5 high school located in District 3, 10, 13, 14 and 28. For top 30 high schools, District 2 contains the most high schools, followed by District 3. Others located in districts belong to each County except the Richmond County. For top 50 high schools, over 10 of them located in District 2, and the Richmond County still does not contain a high school. For top 100 high schools, over 15 of them located in District 2, followed by District 28 belongs to the Queens County. District 8, 15, 16, 18, 19, 23, 29 do not have top 100 high schools. Maps above show the percentage of high school in varying ranks. We could find that District 2 always contains the highest percentage of the high-quality high schools, but this advantage becomes less obvious as the number of schools increases. 5.3 The Impact of Varying-ranking High School Education Quality In the previous two sections, it is easy to see that the quality of education varies from different boroughs and school districts. Then we want to figure out how much of a gap there is between students at different levels of education. Will it really affect future study of students? Avoiding replacement, “Top 10” level includes schools with Ranking 1 to 10, “Top 50” level shows the increasing school from “Top 10” and includes schools with Ranking 11 to 50, and the same with “Top 100” and “Over 100”. The SAT is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States.And SAT score consists of two components: 1) Math and 2) Evidence-based Reading and Writing (ERW). Each component is scored from 200 to 800 points. A higher SAT score means a better chance of getting into a top-ranked college. So SAT scores are an important part of a high school’s education. For sat math scores, from the boxplot above, we can see that there really is a big gap between the different ranked schools. The higher the ranked schools, the better math scores students can get. Top10 high schools have a mode math score of over 700, but the over100 high schools have a mode score of only 425. And top50 students have a wide range of scores, with the lowest score being 475 and the highest score being 725. From the ridgeline, we could find that the higher the ranking level, the more volatile the distribution of grades. It suggests that the higher the ranking level, the larger educational quality gap between schools. The distribution of writing scores is essentially the same as for math score. While we knew that performance would vary from one ranked school to another, we didn’t know that there would be such a significant difference. The top 25% of students at over100 schools can only reach the bottom 25% of the top50. 5.4 Impact of Covid on attendance Once we had an understanding of the geographic distribution of high schools, the rankings, we wanted to find out if Covid had an impact on high schools. We will analyze the change in high school attendance in 2020 and then compare the number of Covid infections to draw conclusions. ## [1] &quot;/Users/zhangxinyu/5293-final-project&quot; The red line represents the total number of enrolled, green represents the number of participants, and blue represents the number of absentees. From the above time series, we can see that there is a clear abnormal change from June to September. According to the School Year Calendar of nyc department of education, we know that there are some vacation dates for school, 2/21-2/25 is Midwinter Recess, school closed, 6/ 27-9/1 is summer break and 11/25 is Thanksgiving break. It is normal to see a sharp increase in absence during these holiday days. However, from February to April, we can still see fluctuations in the number of absences, so we will focus on the analysis of attendance from February to April later The y-axis represents the number of covid cases confirmed per day, CASE_COUNT represents the number of cases confirmed in New York City as a whole, and the other colors represent the number of cases in each borough. The time series chart above shows that March and April are the months when the number of Covid daily infections is increasing rapidly, which corresponds exactly to the situation when the high school attendance rate starts to change in March and April ## # A tibble: 6 × 5 ## Date Enrolled Present Absent rate ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2020-01-02 943218 799582 143313 0.848 ## 2 2020-01-02 931366 748026 182315 0.803 ## 3 2020-01-03 943532 854161 89047 0.905 ## 4 2020-01-03 931595 770132 161063 0.827 ## 5 2020-01-04 943633 848887 94416 0.900 ## 6 2020-01-06 931831 852523 78990 0.915 The attendance rate calculation also validates our previous time series plot. We calculated the average attendance of each school in 2020 and wanted to see how many schools had lower attendance rate. The dot plot allows us to clearly see that most schools have attendance rates above 0.7, so we will then focus the analysis on schools with attendance rates less than 0.7. The total number of schools with an average attendance rate of less than 0.7 in 2020 is 45, and when we divide these schools by region, we find that Kings has more schools with low attendance rates, while Richmond has only one, which may be related to the geographic distribution of high schools we analyzed earlier, with more high schools in Kings but fewer in Richmond. However, there is one school in Manhattan with a surprisingly low attendance rate of 0.4. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component This section we will show other factors might cause the gap of the quality of education in varying ranking level of schools. We randomly select 10 schools in each level and use following factors: • Enrollment: Total number of students in each school. • Survey: Average of Percent Positive of each question in the survey. • Principal_experience: Years of principal experience at this school. • Teach_3_more_exp: Percent of teachers with 3 or more years of experience. • Grad_rate: Graduation rate of students in each school. • Val_pct_cpci_all: College and Career Preparatory Course Index • BoroughName: The borough that the school located in. • Top: The ranking level. outlier： “Enrollment” has upper outliers from high-ranking schools, “survey” has lower outliers from high-ranking schools, “Val_pct_cpci_all” has lower outliers from low-ranking schools. distribution： Over 75% of schools has less than 1500 students. Most of survey Percent Positive is larger than 0.8, meaning that most students have a high opinion of the school. Years of principal experience is mainly concentrated below 12.5. Most of schools has 80% of teachers with 3 or more years of experience. Nearly all of the school have over 80% of graduation rate. The higher the ranking level, the higher CPCI index it is, meaning that high-ranking schools are more emphasis on College and Career Preparatory education. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 summary of studies of the datasets 7.2 Limitation： 7.3 Future directions: 7.4 Lessons Learned:", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 summary of studies of the datasets Based on the analysis above, we could do a brief summary as following. The geographic distribution and the density of high schools in NYC is not evenly. The Richmond County has the fewest educational resources. No.2 school district has the most educational resources located on the Manhattan County. Also, No.2 school district has more High-ranking schools than any other school districts. High-ranking high schools make students more likely to be admitted to a better college, since students are more likely obtain high SAT scores. And there will be such a significant difference because of varying levels of ranking. The higher the ranking level, the larger educational quality gap between schools, the more that school emphasis on College and Career Preparatory education, the more experience teachers in the school, the higher graduation rate, etc. Covid does have an impact on attendance, especially in March and April when there is a sharp increase in the number of confirmed cases. Some high schools have an average attendance rate of less than 70% in February, March and April, and some schools have an average attendance rate of only 40%, which means that only half of the students come to class during these three months. This shows that Covid has a great impact on students 7.2 Limitation： We used five datasets to analyze New York high schools. Each of these five datasets includes a very large amount of information. However, in our analysis, we did not use all of the data, but rather picked out the data that we thought would be useful or relevant to the problem we were trying to solve. This may have some limitations in the analysis. When analyzing the impact of covid on attendance, we can only find attendance data from 2018 to 2020, but Covid is from the end of 2019 to now, if we can use data from 2018 to 2021, I believe we can know more specifically how much Covid affects attendance. Also when analyzing how different schools are ranked, we only have the average of SAT scores for each school, not for each student. The boxplot that comes out this way may be biased, if a student has a very high sat score at an over100 school, but it is not reflected in a mean boxplot. 7.3 Future directions: We could focus more on the changes in school rankings, since we know that school rankings vary from year to year and different websites have different rankings. If we could have more Edu Quality Data to analyze, we could try to identify schools that have potential. 7.4 Lessons Learned: After completing this final project, we gained a better understanding of visualization we learned in this semester. We are very professional in using “dplyr” and “base r” now. By using the data processing skills we learned, we cleaned up our datasets through dealing with NAs, removed some data we didn’t need, merged two data, converted the data types and added some columns for our analysis. For the main part of project, we have created many different types of diagrams that we have learned in the classes, such as histogram, choropleth map, boxplot, ridgeline plot, time series, and cleveland dot plot. These plots are very helpful in solving problems, and by drawing them, we can understand more about what was said in class, such as the color of the plots, the ordering, etc. We learned a lot of very important knowledge in this class that will help us in our future work and study. We really enjoyed the visualization process and this class! "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
